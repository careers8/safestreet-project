CityIQ Project SafeStreet

<br> ORGANIZATION: IGNITE | SCALE | SAN DIEGO 2019 Smart Cities Hackathon and Innovation Program

<br> PURPOSE: The goal of the CityIQ Project SafeStreet is to analyze CityIQ sensor data in order to determine what features predict traffic-related deaths on San Diego County roadways.

<br> <b>UPDATE: The City of San Diego has ended its contract with the CityIQ data provider ( Ubicquia, Inc. ), and data is no longer accessible through the API. This notebook therefore exists as a CityIQ data analysis proof-of-concept.</b>
